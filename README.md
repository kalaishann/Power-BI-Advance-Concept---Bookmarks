#### Problem Statement:
- Client want to view sales and profit insights on SINGLE PAGE.
- If they didn't mentioned page criteria we could create more than one page and used the page navigator to doddle in between since the requirement is for SINGLE PAGE REPORT we could achieve that by grouping two set of visuals using selection pane and make it as a bookmarks.
- Here i have created a button for sales and profit to show two different set of visuals accordingly By using Bookmarks & selection pane
